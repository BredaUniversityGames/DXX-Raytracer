//  A gun can have associated with it any number of joints.  In order to tell whether a gun is a certain
//  state (such as FIRE or ALERT), you should call this function and check the returned joint positions
//  against the robot's gun's joint positions.  This function should also be called to determine how to
//  move a gun into a desired position.
//  For now (May 30, 1994), it is assumed that guns will linearly interpolate from one joint position to another.
//  There is no ordering of joint movement, so it's impossible to guarantee that a strange starting position won't
//  cause a gun to move through a robot's body, for example.

//      Returns number of joints in list.
//      jp_list_ptr is stuffed with a pointer to a static array of joint positions.  This pointer is valid forever.
